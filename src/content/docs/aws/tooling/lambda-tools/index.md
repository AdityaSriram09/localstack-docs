LocalStackâ€™s Lambda Tools offer a set of utilities to streamline the local development, testing, and debugging of AWS Lambda functions. Emulating Lambda behavior on your machine lets you skip cloud deployments and iterate faster in a fully local environment.

These tools are designed to shorten feedback loops and improve the developer experience with features like:

- **IDE debugging**: Attach a debugger to your running Lambda function, set breakpoints, inspect variables, and step through code.

- **Hot reload**: Automatically apply code changes without needing to redeploy the function, enabling rapid iteration.

- **LocalStack Toolkit for VSCode**: The [LocalStack Toolkit for VS Code](https://github.com/localstack/localstack-vscode-extension) enables you to install, configure, and run LocalStack without leaving VS Code.
